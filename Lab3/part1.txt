1a) A relation specifies that the given objects are associated with one another, for which the input and output are related. A function is takes input, and outputs a unique value for that given input.

1b) Every function is a relation since the input and output are permanently related.

1c) Every relation is not a function because a relation need not a unique output value for each input value.

   loves(aboy, mia)
    │     │     │
    │     └ These are both atoms.
    └ This is the functor. It has arity two.

   boxer(Butch)
    │     └ This is a variable.
    └ This is the functor. It has arity one.

           ┌ These are both variables.

   and(big(X), kahuna(X))
    │   │       │
    │   └ These are both complex terms of and(). They are each functors with arity one.
    └ This is the functor. It has arity two.

                ┌ This is a complex term of the first big(). It is a functor with arity one.
                │   ┌ This is an atom.
   hide(X, big(big(aBoy)))
    │   │   └ This is a complex term of hide(). It is a functor with arity one.
    │   └ This is a variable.
    └ This is the functor. It has arity two.


4b) likes(sam, Food) :- indian(Food), mild(Food).
    likes(sam, Food) :- turkish(Food).
    indian(curry).
    indian(tandoori).
    mild(tandoori).
    turkish(tabuleh).

    There are two rules, four facts, six clauses, and four predicates. The head of the rules is "likes(sam, Food)", the goals are "indian(Food), mild(Food)" and "turkish(Food)".
