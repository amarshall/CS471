/* 1: Below are 3 structures that representation expression trees using Prolog.
      (Op is any Prolog operator.)

     expTree(Op,Lt,Rt).
     expTree(lit,Value).
     expTree(Op,T).

    Write a Prolog program:
         eval(Tree,Value).
    which succeeds if Value is the result of computing the expressions 
    represented by an expression tree.  For example:

   ?- eTree4(T),eval(T,V).
   T = expTree(float, expTree(sin, expTree(/, expTree(lit, pi), expTree(lit, 2))))
   V = 1.0

   ?- eTree1(T),eval(T,V).
   T = expTree(+, expTree(lit, 5), expTree(*, expTree(lit, 3), expTree(lit, 2)))
   V = 11

   Below are trees you can use for testing.
   
   This can be done with only 3 clauses  -- if you understand lab 4.

/*2. countLit(ExpTree,NumLit) is successful if  number of "lit" nodes in an 
     expTree structure unifies with NoLit. i.e.

     ?- eTree1(T), countLit(T,N).

/*
      Keep in mind, though, that terms such as U+V are still trees with the
      functor at the root, and that evaluation of such terms requires 
      additional processing which you will complete.
        
      Define the predicate, 'evaluate', that uses the result from 
      differentiation (above) and a list of values for each variable and 
      computes the resulting value. e.g.

   ?- d(3*(x +2*x*x),x,Result), LVarValue=[x:3], evaluate(Result,Value,LVarValue).
   Result = 3* (1+ (2*x*1+x*2))+ (x+2*x*x)*0
   LVarValue = [x:3]
   Value = 39 .
   ?- d((3*x) ^ 4,x,Result), VarValue=[x:2] , evaluate(Result,Value,LVarValue).
   Result = 4* (3*x)^3*3,
   LVarValue = x:2,
   Value = 2592 .
 
     The only built-predicates you may use are (You won't need all of them):
     is, //, /, +, -, ^, *,=..,>, <, 
     atom, is_list, functor, arg, integer, number, member, append

/* 5: Write a predicate change/2 that given the change amount, computes the ways 
      in which we can give change.  Use USA's  coin denominations above.
      
      The predicate "change" is such that an positive integer S, 
      change(S,T) "returns" a list of tuples, T, where the tuple contains the
      name of the denomination (Name,Count), 
      the atom Name of the denomination and integer Count that gives 
      the number of coins of each denomination in D that add up to S.
      (Notice that you do not have to be able to generate or 
      validate all possible solutions.)
      For example::
        ?- change(127,L).
        L = [ (dollar, 1), (quarter, 1), (penny, 2)] 
        Yes
        ?- change(44,L).
        L = [ (quarter, 1), (dime, 1), (nickel, 1), (penny, 4)] ;
        L = [ (quarter, 1), (dime, 1), (penny, 9)] ;
        L = [ (quarter, 1), (nickel, 3), (penny, 4)] ;
        L = [ (quarter, 1), (penny, 19)] ;
        L = [ (dime, 4), (penny, 4)] ;
        L = [ (nickel, 8), (penny, 4)] ;
        L = [ (penny, 44)] ;
        No
      
      This can be solved with only 2 clauses.
      
      The Coin Changing problem is an interesting problem usually studied in
      Algorthms.  http://condor.depaul.edu/~rjohnson/algorithm/coins.pdf is a 
      nice discussion.
      Think about ::
         1) How could we generalize this problem to handle different 
            denominations?  
         2) What are the different techinques to find the change with the
            fewest number of coins ?         
         3) What happens if the order of the "coin" facts change?
