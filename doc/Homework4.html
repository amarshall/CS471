/* Purpose:
   * to reenforce search order.
   * to reenforce recursive programming
   * to reenforce the use of the list data structure in Prolog
   
	1) For some of the problems below you need only generate a correct
      result from the query without requesting alternative results. 
      You may use cuts but it is not required.

/* 1:  : (From Learn Prolog NOW! exercise 3.3)
 * Binary trees are trees where all internal nodes have exactly two
 * children. The smallest binary trees consist of only one leaf node. We
 * will represent leaf nodes as leaf(Label). For instance, leaf(3) and
 * leaf(7) are leaf nodes, and therefore small binary trees. Given two
 * binary trees B1 and B2 we can combine them into one binary tree using
 * the predicate tree: tree(B1,B2). So, from the leaves leaf(1) and
 * leaf(2) we can build the binary tree tree(leaf(1), leaf(2)). And from
 * the binary trees tree(leaf(1), leaf(2)) and leaf(4) we can build the
 * binary tree tree(tree(leaf(1), leaf(2)), leaf(4)).

 * Now, define a predicate swap/2, which produces a mirror image of the
 * binary tree that is its first argument. For example:

    ?- swap(tree(tree(leaf(1), leaf(2)), leaf(4)),T).
    T = tree(leaf(4), tree(leaf(2), leaf(1))).
    yes

/* 2: Given a tree, define a predicate equivT(Tree,ETree), that success if

/** 4:  "Send more money" is a well-known puzzle. Each of the letters
    D,E,M,N,O,R,S and Y represents a different digit. Moreover, when each
    letter is mapped to its corresponding digit the equation SEND + MORE =
    MONEY holds. Below is a very naive implementation. Since there are 
    8 letters to be solved, it simply explore the 10*9*...*3 mappings of 
    letters to digits. 
    A little insight can simplify things. Clearly, SEND < 9999 and 
    MORE < 9999. Thus MONEY < 19998 and hence M = 1. 
    Now we have SEND + 1ORE = 1ONEY. Again SEND < 9999 
     and now 1ORE < 1999 so 1ONEY < 11998. Since M is already bound to 1, 
     O must be bound to 0. A little more thought shows that S must be
     bound to 8 or 9, and that N = E + 1. Using these insights to reduce
     the number of solutions that must be explored, write a Prolog
     predicate soln([D,E,M,N,O,R,S,Y]) that solves this puzzle by binding
     the correct digits to each of the variables in the list. (Modified 
     from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~fischer/)

/* 5:  Syntax-Directed Differentiation:  A motivating example illustrating the 
         power of pattern matching in Prolog.
         Consider the following rules for symbolic differentiation
         (U, V are mathematical expressions, x is a variable):

        dx/dx = 1
        d(C)/x = 0.
        d(Cx)/x = C               (C is a constant)
        d(-U)/dx = -(dU/dx)
        d(U+V)/dx = dU/dx + dV/dx
        d(U-V)/dx = dU/dx - dV/dx
        d(U*V)/dx = U*(dV/dx) + V*(dU/dx)
        d(U^n)/dx = nU^(n-1)*(dU/dx)

        These rules can easily be translated into Prolog, for instance,
        the second rule can be defined as
                   d(C,x,0):-integer(C).
          and the fifth rule can be defined as
                   d(U+ V ,x, DU+ DV):-d(U,x,DU),d(V,x,DV).

         Write the remaining rules. Here is a test query:

            ?- d(3*(x +2*x*x),x,Result).
            Result = 3* (1+ (2*x*1+x*2))+ (x+2*x*x)*0 ;
            Result = 3* (1+ (2*x*1+x* (2*1+x*0)))+ (x+2*x*x)*0 ;
            false.

            ?- d(3*(x +2*x*x),x,Result).
            Result = 3* (1+ (2*x*1+x*2))+ (x+2*x*x)*0 .


        Keep in mind, though, that terms such as U+V are still trees with the
        functor at the root, and that evaluation of such terms requires 
        additional processing .  See next week's assignment.
        1 clause for each definition.
