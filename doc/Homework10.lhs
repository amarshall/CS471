Problem 1: Thompson 10.3
  In lab you did the following problem:
  Problem 4: Thompson 10.3
  Define a function composeList which composes a list of functions 
  into a single function.
  What is the effect of your function on an empty list of functions?
  Define composeList using primitive recursion.
  
Redo the definition. The definition should use a 'fold' and it 
   should be only be one line AND no explicit arguments (i.e. complete
   composeHOF = ?????).
    


Problem 2: (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence )
"In mathematics, the Thue-Morse sequence, or Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence, is a 
binary sequence that begins:

  0 01 0110 01101001 0110100110010110 01101001100101101001011001101001 ...

(if your sequence starts with one..)
    1 10 1001 10010110 1001011001101001...."

...
"Characterization using bitwise negation

The Thueâ€“Morse sequence in the form given above, as a sequence of bits, 
can be defined recursively using the operation of bitwise negation. So, the 
first element is 0. Then once the first 2n elements have been specified, 
forming a string s, then the next 2n elements must form the bitwise negation of 
s. Now we have defined the first 2n+1 elements, and we recurse.

Spelling out the first few steps in detail:

    * We start with 0.
    * The bitwise negation of 0 is 1.
    * Combining these, the first 2 elements are 01.
    * The bitwise negation of 01 is 10.
    * Combining these, the first 4 elements are 0110.
    * The bitwise negation of 0110 is 1001.
    * Combining these, the first 8 elements are 01101001.
    * And so on.
So
    * T0 = 0.
    * T1 = 01."
    
Define a primitive recursive function 'thue' given the nth thue element returns
the next thue element.  The elements will be represented as a list of 0s and 1s.
e.g.
   Haskell1F11> thue [0,1,1,0]
   [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]



Problem 3:

Using the circular list idea demostrated in fibSeq
  (http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/%7Ehead/CS471/NOTES/HASKELL/4hF02.html)
  Define thueSeq to be a sequence of thue elements.
  You should use list comprehension.
e.g.
  Haskell2F10Sol> take 5 thueSeq
  [[0],[0,1],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]]
  


Problem 4:  (List comprehension)
(Only use list comprehension notation )
(From Thompson 17.23)  Give a definition of the function

    factor :: Integral a => a -> [a]

which returns a list containg the factors of a positive integer.  For instance

    factors 12 = [1,2,3,4,6,12]



Problem 5:
Define a primitive recursive function 'merge' that given two sorted lists returns 
a sorted list with all the unique elements from lists.  
e.g.
   Haskell2S10> merge [1,8,9,100] [3,7,9,99,100]    
   [1,3,7,8,9,99,100]

> merge (x:xs) (y:ys)
>     | x == y          = x : merge xs     ys
>     | x < y           = x : merge xs     (y:ys)
>     | otherwise       = y : merge (x:xs) ys

> merge _ _ =[]



Problem 6:  (Thompson 17.23 )
Define the list of numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3, and 5, the
so-called Hamming numbers:


   ...> take 15 hamming
   [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15,16,18,20,24]


 You may consider using any combinition of the following techiques
       to express your solution  list comprehension notation, 
       and/or explicit recursion, and/or local definitions .

(Hint: Apply the circular list idea demostrated in fibSeq
  (http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/%7Ehead/CS471/NOTES/HASKELL/4hF02.html)) 
           



Problem 7: (Thompson 10.13)
  Find functions f1 and f2 so that
 
   s8 =  map f1 . filter f2

  has the same effect as
 

> p8 = filter (>0) . map (+1)

 
  ....> p8 [-4,4, -3,3,12,-12]
  [5,4,13]
  (99 reductions, 153 cells)
  ....> s8 [-4,4, -3,3,12,-12]
  [5,4,13]
  (90 reductions, 137 cells)

Answer: 



Problem 8:A redefine sumHarmonic using a HOF:

The harmonic series is the following infinite series:
                            1   1   1   1               1
                      1 +   - + - + - + - + ...   + ... - ..
                            2   3   4   5               i
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics))
Write a function sumHarmonic such that sumHarmonic i is the sum of the first i
terms of this series. For example, sumHarmonic 4 ~> 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ~> 2.08333...
                                                        2   3   4
sumHarmonic may have type  Fractional a => a -> a.

Rewrite the definition from lab using either foldr or foldl. (i.e. figure out 
what ??? should be.  You can use a lambda abstraction in your definition.)
  sumH = foldr ??? 0
or 
  sumH = foldl ??? 0
  
   ...> sumHarmonic 20
   3.59773965714368
   ...> sumH [1..20]
   3.59773965714368




Problem 9: Use 'map', a 'fold', (.), length and "()"  to define  sumLengths 
           that takes a list of lists and returns the sum of all 
           their lengths. (A little tricky) i.e.  
           
  ...> sumlengths [[12,4,5,6],[1,2,4],[1,2]]
  9

  > sumlengths =
