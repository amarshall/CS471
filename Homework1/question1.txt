Overall I prefer Ruby over Python. One of the many syntax differences between Ruby and Python is Ruby's optional parenthesis. For example, normally a method call would require parenthesis `mymethod(a, b)`, however in Ruby you can simply do `mymethod a, b`. This can read much nicer, as what is really unnecessary punctuation is getting in the way. When writing code, there's not much of an advantage other than the one less character needed to be typed.
